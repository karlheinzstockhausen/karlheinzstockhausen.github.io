I am an undergraduate student who is interested in music, in particular musicology and composition. I am currently studying under James Ledger. I live in Perth, WA. I have written for entities such as the Perth Festival, Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camp, the University of Western Australia's Conservatorium of Music's "New Music Ensemble" and Pi√±ata Percussion.
