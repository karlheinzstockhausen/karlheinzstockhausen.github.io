I am an undergraduate student who is interested in music, in particular musicology and composition. I am currently studying under James Ledger. I live in Perth, WA. I have written for entities such as the Perth Festival, the Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camp, and Pi√±ata Percussion. I have worked with distinguished musicians such as Jonathan Fitzgerald and Semra Lee-Smith.<br>
<br>
I have collaborated with klezmer violinist Morgan Maruthiah.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
