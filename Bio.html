I am currently studying under Elliott Gyger at the University of Melbourne, and was previously studying with James Ledger at the University of Western Australia.&nbsp; I have written for entities such as the Perth Festival, the Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camp, Pi√±ata Percussion, and UWA's Wind Orchestra and Symphony Orchestra. I have worked with distinguished musicians such as Jonathan Fitzgerald and Semra Lee-Smith.<br>
<br>
I have collaborated with klezmer violinist Morgan Maruthiah.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
