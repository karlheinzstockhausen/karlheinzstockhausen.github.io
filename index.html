Hello! Welcome to my website. Things are still falling in place, but at least the visual aesthetic standards of the site are complete!<br><br>
<h1>Ramblings</h1>
	
<strong> 22 January</strong> The Perth Festival will be utilising my fanfare, "The Great Fire of Rome", for events this year held at the Studio Underground in the State Theatre Centre of WA.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>

	
<strong> 19 January</strong> - 2020's National Music Camp has recently concluded and I was a participant of the composition program. Melody Eötvös' immense compositional knowledge has been directly exposed to me and as a necessary consequent, I have become even more inspired. To add to things, I met three other talented composer and many more musicians who expressed their passion and ability through performances. Isn't that amazing!? Oh, and I also had a piece premiered.
